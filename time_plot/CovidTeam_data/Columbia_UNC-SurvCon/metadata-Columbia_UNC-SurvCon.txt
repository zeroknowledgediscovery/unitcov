team_model_designation: primary
methods: A survival-convolution model with piece-wise transmission rates that incorporates
  latent incubation period and provides time-varying effective reproductive number.
team_funding: NIH grant GM124104
data_inputs: confirmed cases and deaths from JHU CSSE https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series

methods_long: We predict COVID-19 daily new cases using a robust and parsimonious
  survival-convolution model. We account for transmission during the pre-symptomatic
  incubation period, use a time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) to reflect
  the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention,
  and quantify uncertainty by permutation. We use a regression model to predict cumulative
  deaths from estimated time-lagged cumulative total number of COVID-19 cases.
