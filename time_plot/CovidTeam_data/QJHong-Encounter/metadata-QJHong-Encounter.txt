  today''s "Daily New Confirmed Cases" + today''s "Encounter Density" ==> today''s
  newly infected Cases ==> next 2-3 weeks'' "Daily New Confirmed Cases" (Encounter
  Density D data source: Unacast''s Social Distancing Scoreboard, which analyzes cell
  phone location data, counts "Human Encounters", defined as two      cell phone devices
  that were in the same place at the same time, and then derives the probability and
  "Encounter Density".)

  My model uses current "Encounter Density" D to predict future "Reproductive Number"
  R and "Daily New Confirmed Cases". This is the most fundamental idea and    assumption
  in this model.

  The strong correlation between R and D (D is shifted by 22 days) is evident. While
  social distancing quickly brought down R, easing policy is slowly increasing R back
  above 1.

  Using (1) R and D relation in the past as a training set, (2) future D as input,
  and (3) machine learning / regression, my model can predict future R, and ultimately
  future Daily New Cases.'
