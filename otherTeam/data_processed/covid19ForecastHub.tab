Facebook AI Research,Neural Relational Autoregressive Model,We combine recurrent neural networks with a vector autoregressive model and train the joint model with a specific regularization scheme that increases the coupling between regions. This approach is akin to using Granger causality as a relational inductive bias and helps training of high-resolution models by borrowing statistical strength across regions.,https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/neural-relational-autoregression-for-high-resolution-covid-19-forecasting/,https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/covid-19-forecasts/,FAIR-NRAR
CovidAnalytics at MIT,This model predicts based on an SEIR model augmented with underdetection and interventions. Projections account for reopening and assume interventions would be re-enacted if cases continue to climb.,"This model makes predictions for future cases based on a heavily modified SEIR model. New states are added to the SEIR model to account for cases that went undetected, and an explicit death state is included. The infection rate is corrected with a nonlinear curve that represents the governmental and societal response (which is assumed to change according to the magnitude of the outbreak). Key parameters for the disease are fixed using a metanalysis  conducted by the CovidAnalytics group of over 150 parameters while epidemiological parameters are fitted to hisotical death counts and detected cases.",https://www.covidanalytics.io/DELPHI_documentation_pdf,https://www.covidanalytics.io/,CovidAnalytics-DELPHI

No assumptions are made regarding reopening or governmental interventions. The model is jointly fit across all 50 US states, after some time-alignment is performed as a preprocessing step to facilitate comparison between states. Heavier weight is placed on more recent training data, to account for nonstationarity in the underlying process. A lasso penalty is added to induce variable selection and prevent overfitting. Quantiles are computed using a residual (Gaussian) bootstrap, separately for each location.

Steve McConnell,"National level and state level, near-term (1-4 week) fatality forecasts.","This is a near-term fatality prediction model that calculates and uses fatality trends at the national and state level, trends in positive virus tests and total virus tests, and age-related demographics for state forecasts.
Model forecasts are based on predicting near-term deaths from recent positive virus tests. The model assumes average delays of 4 days from infection to test, 14-17.5 days from positive test to death, and 18 days from infection to death. No assumptions are made about the effectiveness of interventions or treatments; the model assumes that any such change in effectiveness will be included implicitly in the historical fatality data and the fatality rates calculated from that data. This model uses a Rational Actor assumption for weeks 3-4, in which states that  have death rates below their historical averages remain flat and states that have  death rates above their historical averages revert toward their averages.

NotreDame-mobility,"This is an ensemble of nine models that are identical except that they are driven by different mobility indices from Apple and Google. The model underlying each is a deterministic, SEIR-like model.","This forecast is an ensemble of nine models that are identical except that they are driven by different mobility indices from Apple and Google. The model underlying each is a deterministic, SEIR-like model. Model simulations are initiated by imported infections, which arrive from January 1 onward according to a scaled Normal probability density. Each imported and then local infection gives rise to an average number of secondary infections distributed forward in time according to a generation interval distribution. Once infected, a proportion of those infected die at times distributed according to a distribution between symptom onset and death. Testing of a subset of symptomatic infections is distributed in time in a similar manner, and the model is fitted to data on test positivity by accounting for those seeking testing and a differential probabililty of seeking testing conditional on one's infection status. The model is simultaneously fitted to deaths according to a Poisson likelihood of daily incidence of death. There are a total of twelve model parameters that are all estimated. First, a parameter sweep is conducted to identify the parameter combination from the sweep with the highest likelihood. Then, a region around that parameter combination is assumed to have a uniform prior, and a posterior set of parameters is obtained with MCMC. The model is then simulated forward under each sampled parameter set from the posterior distribution. This process is repeated for each of nine mobility metrics from Apple and Google for 50 states and some territories where at least one type of mobility data is available. Simulations from the posterior predictive distribution of each model are pooled evenly and used to generate a probabilistic forecast in each state and at the national level.",Missing,https://github.com/TAlexPerkins/covid19_NDmobility_forecasting,NotreDame-mobility

US Army Engineer Research and Development Center,"The ERDC SEIR model makes predictions of several variables (e.g., reported new/cumulative cases  per day, etc.). Model parameters are estimated using historical data using Bayesian inference.","The ERDC SEIR model is a process-based model that mathematically describes the virus  dynamics in a population center (e.g., state, CBSA) using assumptions that are common  in compartmental models: (i)   modeled populations are large enough that fluctuations in the disease  states grow slower than averages (i.e., coefficient of variation < 1) (ii)  recovered individuals are neither infectious nor become susceptible to  further infection.
The model is similar to classic SEIR models but with additional compartments for  unreported infections and isolated individuals.  Model parameters describing reporting  rates and transmission rates are allowed to vary in time over over the historical  record as social and policy factors change.  Forecasts into the future, however,  are made under the assumption that the parameters are held constant in time.
The model parameters are estimated from observations of the cumulative number of  cases using a Bayesian approach. Information from subject matter experts (SMEs) is  used to develop a prior probability distribution over the model parameters.  This  then combined with a statistical model of the model-data mismatch to produce a posterior  probability distribution over the model parameters that incorporates both the cumulative  observations and subject matter expertise.

COVID-19 Forecast Hub,This model is a baseline predictive model.,"For predictions of incidence, the median prediction at all future horizons is the most recent observed incidence.  Predictions of cumulative counts are derived from predictions of incidence; this means that the slope of the predictive medians for cumulative quantities from one week to the next will be constant and equal to the last observed slope.  To get a distribution around the median, we look at how much incidence has changed from week to week in the past, and we allow for the possibility that similar changes will occur again in the future.
In more technical detail, forecasts of incidence are generated through the following procedure: 1) Calculate first differences of incidence; 2) Collect all first differences and their negatives; 3) Sample first differences in incidence and add to the most recent observed incidence; 4) Enforce that the mean of the predictive distribution for incidence is equal to the most recent observed incidence; 5) truncate the predictive distribution for incidence at 0.

John Burant (JCB),The Political Realities Model (PRM) is built on observations of macro-level societal and political responses to COVID measured only in terms of infections and deaths.,"The Political Realities Model (PRM) is built on observations of macro-level societal and political responses to COVID19 characterized only in terms of infections and deaths. The starting point of the model is the hypothesis that although individuals and policy makers have responded to the epidemic with a wide variety of behavioral modifications and policy actions, the actual net impact of the measures taken, though not identical across time or geography, is predictable. Moreover, these predictions can be based upon what a society and its elected officials have demonstrated it (they) will accept as a reasonable aggregate impact from COVID19. This model seeks to identify one or more ""acceptability"" range(s) from observation of the epidemic up to the current time and to understand how much impact on infection rates is achieved by responses in this (these) range(s). Deaths, in turn, are related to infections via a simple (time- and geographically-varying) phenomenological model derived through fitting. This allows the model to build in spatiotemporal variation in the demographics of the population, its access to health care & COVID testing, and the actual infection fatality rate without explicitly considering these factors. At present the model is deterministic rather than probabilistic, and so only provides point forecasts. The model considers the United States at the state level.",Missing,https://github.com/JohnBurant/COVID19-PRM,JCB-PRM
Discrete Dynamical Systems,Jointly modeling daily deaths and cases using a negative binomial distribution based nonparametric Bayesian generalized linear dynamical system.,"We introduce negative binomial linear dynamical system (NBDS) to jointly model daily deaths and cases reported at all 50 US States and D.C. NBDS is a nonparametric Bayesian hierarchical model built on the graph gamma process (GGP). Generated from the GGP is an infinite dimensional directed sparse random graph, which is constructed by taking the OR operation of countably infinite binary adjacency matrices that share the same set of countably infinite nodes. Each of these adjacency matrices is associated with a weight to indicate its overall activation strength, and places a finite number of edges between a finite subset of nodes belonging to the same community. We use the generated random graph, whose number of nonzero-degree nodes is finite, to define both the sparsity patterns and dimensions of the latent state transition matrices of generalized linear dynamical systems. We show how the formed overlapping communities in the latent space can provide interpretable latent transition patterns of the COVID-19 time series, providing good predictive performance and uncertainty estimation.",https://dds-covid19.github.io/,https://dds-covid19.github.io/,DDS-NBDS
The University of Michigan,Nation-level model of confirmed cases and deaths based on ridge regression.

The ridge regressors built for this model use Finite Impulse Response (FIR)  filtration to predict each day's confirmed cases and deaths as a function of  the counts on previous days. Specifically, each day's counts are predicted as  a linear combination of the counts on a user-specified number of previous days.  The goal of the regressors is the determination of an optimal coefficient vector  for these predictive linear combinations. The model currently makes predictions  based on the previous 14 days.

Los Alamos National Labs,"This model makes predictions about the future, unconditional on particular intervention strategies. Statistical dynamical growth model accounting for population susceptibility.","This model makes predictions about the future, unconditional on particular  intervention strategies. The model consists of two processes. The first process  is a statistical model of how the  number of COVID-19 infections changes over time. The second process maps the number of  infections to the reported data. We model the growth of new cases as the product of a  dynamic growth parameter and the underlying numbers of susceptible and infected cases  in the population at the previous time step, scaled by the size of the state's starting  susceptible population. Change 2020-10-29: The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of the virus in that state on that date and is a weighted regression between the   trend in the growth rate over the past 42 days and a growth rate that would keep  the number of new daily confirmed cases constant. The weights of these two components are dynamically tuned to the observed data. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that a fraction of the 1,2,3,4, or 5-week moving average of the daily  confirmed cases will die.

We call this the Universal Influenza-like Transmission (UnIT) score. This new epidemiologically informed risk score leverages subtle geospatial patterns from seasonal flu epidemics of the past, and significantly improves incidence forecasts for COVID-19. Additionally, the UnIT score emerges as the most important factor explaining observed county-specific incidence trends for COVID-19 in the US, with coefficients in multi-variate regression far outweighing those for typical co-variates. Thus, our key insight is that past incidence patterns for a different pathogen can substantially inform current projections, provided the transmission mechanisms are broadly similar.

We produce a number of different intervention scenarios, each assuming various interventions and rates of compliance are implemented in the future.  This submission is the selection of the weekly scenario we believe to be most plausible given current observations and planned intervention policies.  The selected scenarios are listed below: November 8 - present '5_2xhold': This scenario assumes a weekly 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week, the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection. October 4 - November 5 '5_1xhold': This scenario assumes a one-time 5% increase in contact rates, which is applied at the start of the projection and maintained for one week.  After one week, the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection. June 14 - September 27 '5_2xhold': This scenario assumes a weekly 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week, the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.   June 7 '80contact1x5p' : This scenario assumes a weekly 20% decrease in counties with growing weekly cases and stay-at-home orders in place, and a one-time 5% increase in states that have reopened. May 7 - June 4 '80contactw5p': For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply a weekly 5% increase to the contact rate of counties in those states. May 3 '80contact1x10p': For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rate during the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain this new increased rate for the remainder of the projection. April 12 - April 26 '70contact': This scenario mimics adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g. school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 30% contact rate reduction. Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 30% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario.

Johns Hopkins ID Dynamics COVID-19 Working Group,County-level metapopulation model with commuting and stochastic SEIR disease  dynamics with social-distancing indicators.,"This is a county-level metapopulation model with stochastic SEIR disease  dynamics. This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters  and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social  distancing and stay-at-home orders. Infections are seeded stochastically  with roughly 10 times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days  of a county epidemic and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were  drawn stochastically for each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR dynamics and county commuting data modulates the spread of disease within counties. 
Stay-at-home orders and  subsequent social distancing interventions are updated at the state-level according to recent policy documents. States that did not implement stay-at-home orders had a single social distancing intervention that began on the day of the first reported order and endured  for the whole simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred where  possible.
To model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated  realistic but fixed time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to  ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform  a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we  assume a 0.25% infection fatality rate and a 7:1 ratio of incident  hospitalizations to deaths. 
For each county, we estimate the seeding time and amount, the baseline  reproductive number, the case confirmation to infection ratio, and the  effectiveness of interventions (from closing to phased reopenings). We use an  MCMC-like inference procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly county  aggregations of incident confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA  Facts. For the inference of the baseline reproductive number and the case  confirmation to infection ratio, hierarchical grouping terms enable sharing  of strength among counties in the same state.
Our procedure forecasts incident and cumulative deaths by incorporating the last reported data point (pre-forecast date) from USA Facts.
The estimates reported by this model incorporate uncertainty in both epidemiological parameters (e.g., R0, infectious period, time delays to health outcomes) and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies  on social distancing, stay-at-home orders, and phased reopenings. We submit a single calibration to forecast deaths, cases, and hospitalizations.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20127894v1,https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/COVIDScenarioPipeline,JHU_IDD-CovidSP

Our formulation draws on core methods from both epidemiology and physics. It is data-driven to characterize non-linear transition rates and posits underlying causal mechanisms that we have verified against mobility indices representing physical distancing in mass scale and government response actions.  Our models recalibrate daily with the arrival of new information on COVID-19.  By design, the calibration of our models use region-specific data, as the differences in the timing and execution of government restrictions, testing, population density, social behaviour norms and public responses, re-opening plans, and demographics are extremely relevant.

BPagano,Projects infections and deaths for 223 locations using an SIR model.,"On our website we present daily projections for infections and deaths for 108 countries, 52 US states/territories,   and 63 US counties. For the US we calculate mortality rates by US region and time based on the ages of people infected in a given region. We provide the following data as a function of time and place: cumulative and daily confirmed cases, cumulative and daily deaths, confirmed case-based and death-based effective transmission ratios, fraction of populations infected and constant infections transmission ratio, probability of Covid-19 contact, mortality and undercount, and fraction of positive tests. Our projections are driven by the effective transmission ratio, Rt. More specifically we run an SIR model using deaths and another using cases resulting in Rt for deaths and Rt for cases. We use the average of these two as the starting point or driver for our projections (new: 20-10-18). For forecast how Rt will change with time, we analyze Rt change data through the course of the pandemic and apply a model of that characteristic behavior to forecast infections and deaths. UPDATE 20-10-18: Changed Rt forecast from Rt for deaths to the average of Rt for deaths and Rt for cases. UPDATE 20-10-25: Changed from Sunday forecast to the average of Friday, Saturday and Sunday forecasts. UPDATE 20-11-08: Corrected undercount calculation approach resulting in an increase in forecasted cases.",https://bobpagano.com/covid-19-modeling/,https://bobpagano.com,BPagano-RtDriven

UCLA Statistical Machine Learning Lab,The SuEIR model is a variant of the SEIR model considering both untested and unreported cases. The model considers reopening and assumes susceptible population will increase after the reopen.,"We update our model by considering the effects of reopenings. In particular, for the states that have reopened or partially reopened, we assume there is a transition from a virtual  “Quarantined/Isolated” group to the “Susceptible” group at a certain rate after the reopen date. This rate along with other model parameters are jointly estimated based on the reported data. The key feature of the SuEIR model is that it can infer the untested cases as well as unreported cases. More specifically, we treat the “Exposed” group in the SEIR model as the individuals that have already been infected and have not been tested, which are also capable of infecting the “Susceptible” group. Moreover, some of the people in the “Exposed” group can get tested and transferred to the “Infectious” group (which are reported to the public), while the rest of them will recover/die and transit to the so-called “Unreported Recovered” group (which are not reported to the public).

COVID-19 Simulator,"An interactive tool developed by researchers at Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Georgia Tech and Boston Medical Center to inform COVID-19 intervention policy decisions in the US.","The COVID-19 Simulator uses a validated compartment model to simulate the trajectory of COVID-19 at the state level from March 15, 2020 to August 31, 2020 in the United States. Utilizing the most recent data for each state, the COVID-19 Simulator considers state-specific disease spread dynamics. Specifically, to reproduce the observed trends and project future cases of COVID-19, time-varying and state-specific effective reproductive numbers are estimated and fed as inputs into a compartment model. The compartment model is defined using Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered compartments (i.e., SEIR model) with continuous time progression. Model programming and analysis were performed in R (version 3.6.2), and the package deSolve was used to solve the ordinary differential equation system.",Missing,https://covid19sim.org/,Covid19Sim-Simulator

My model uses current ""Encounter Density"" D to predict future ""Reproductive Number"" R and ""Daily New Confirmed Cases"". This is the most fundamental idea and    assumption in this model.
The strong correlation between R and D (D is shifted by 22 days) is evident. While social distancing quickly brought down R, easing policy is slowly increasing R back above 1.

IQVIA ACOE,Spatio-Temporal Attention Network,We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for state-level pandemic prediction. Our method aims at addressing these limitations and making earlier and more accurate pandemic outbreak predictions by (1) using patients EHR data from different states that encode local disease status and medical resource utilization condition; (2) considering demographic similarity and geographical proximity between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into deep learning models. STAN uses an attention-based graph convolutional network to capture geographical and temporal trends and predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a physical law-based loss term for enhancing long-term prediction.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04215,https://www.iqvia.com/landing/analytics-center-of-excellence,IQVIA_ACOE-STAN
University of California Merced MESA Lab,FoGSEIR model is a modification of integer order SEIR model considering fractional integrals. The model considers the age structure and reopening intervention to minimize infections and deaths.,"The fractional order generalized SEIR model considers the power law functions of infection cases, as well as the recovery and death.   It is necessary to introduce the fractional integral with long memory property based on the integer  order SEIR model. Through the time-weighted performance index (ITSE) of the model fitting and parameter sensitivity analysis  of the model using Simulink Design Optimization (SLDO), it is proved that the fractional order model is superior to the integer order model in terms of short-term prediction. In our model, the more accurate prediction errors of incident death and cumulative death are provided. Based on this model, we can also study the optimization control problem. By studying mobility data, the lock-down and release policies of different countries, states and counties are changed accordingly. Control infection rates to   reduce cumulative infections and deaths effectively. The model can not only fit the prediction of infection cases, but also achieve a balance between the scale of infection and the socioeconomic status by developing age-based re-open intervention through the study of social mobility.",Missing,http://mechatronics.ucmerced.edu/covid19,UCM_MESALab-FoGSEIR

University of Southern California Data Science Lab,A heterogeneous infection rate model with human mobility for epidemic modeling. Our model adapts to changing trends and provide predictions of confirmed cases and deaths.,"We use our own epidemic model called SI-kJalpha, preliminary version of which we have successfully used during DARPA Grand Challenge 2014. Our model can consider the effect of many complexities of the epidemic process and yet be simplified to a few parameters that are learned using fast linear regressions. Therefore, our approach can learn and generate forecasts extremely quickly. On a 2 core desktop machine, our approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters and generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states in the US. The total execution time for 184 countries is 11.83s and for more than 3000 US counties is 101.03s. Despite being fast, the accuracy of our forecasts is on par with the state-of-the-art as demonstrated on the leaderboard page. at https://scc-usc.github.io/ReCOVER-COVID-19. Our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends, and the variations in parameters during different times/policies allow us to forecast different scenarios such as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions. For each state, we model hospitalizations as a separate compartment, as a linear function of recent cases with heterogeneous rates. This means that for some hyper-parameter J, those who were infected at time t-1 to t-J will have a separate rate from those infected at t-(J+1) to t-2J, and so on. This is similar to how we perform death forecasts. For long-term forecasts (more than a few days in the future), the cases are forecasted first based on our SIkJalpha model, which forms the input to hospitalization prediction. While we account for changing trends by putting more emphasis on recently seen data, we assume that the trends will remain the same in the future for our point forecasts. We try to account for changing trends in the future in our quantile forecasts by modeling the empirical error our approach makes using a Random Forest.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05180,https://scc-usc.github.io/ReCOVER-COVID-19,USC-SI_kJalpha
RPI and UW,A mobility-informed simplified SIR model motivated by collision theory.,"We incorporate mobility information into a simplified SIR model which has an analytical solution with only two fitting parameters. Without any social- distancing policy or geological/demographic inputs, the model works very well  for the twenty hardest-hit counties in the United States. This model is quite  different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning.  We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling  exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative  mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative  mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties.  In this forecast, we chose the ~30 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest  of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain  meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above,  fatality-reference, which is the average of the 11-day-period prior to prediction-date.  The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories:  retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in  our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error  analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting  error and the variation of the reference fatality. Quantile forecast is calculated  based on standard error assuming normal distribution. State-level forecast has been  included for 32 states. Other states and county-level forecast will be included later. Starting Nov 29th, we included a summer reduction of 10% from 06/01 to 09/01 and an  election mobility increase of 10% from 09/01 to 11/03. The summer reduction of mobility  accounts for elevated outdoor activities while election mobility increase accounts for  large gatherings of political rally which maybe washed out in the averaged state-mobility.  Google mobility data may have been affected by a recent Sep update.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20162016v1,http://rpi-uw-covid-mobility.herokuapp.com/,RPI_UW-Mob_Collision
NotreDame-FRED,FRED is an agent-based model developed for influenza with parameters modified to represent the natural history of COVID-19,"We used an existing agent-based model, FRED (Framework for Reconstructing Epidemic Dynamics) which was developed by the university of Pittsburgh in response to the 2009 influenza pandemic (Grefenstette et al. 2013). We modified the model parameters to represent the natural history of COVID-19 and calibrated a set of parameters to reproduce current trends of deaths due to COVID-19 in the US. FRED simulates the spread of the virus in a population by recreating interactions among people on a daily basis. To accurately represent the population of each of the states simulated, we used a synthetic population of the US that represents demographic and geographic characteristics of the population in 2010 (Wheaton 2012). Each human is modeled as an agent that visits a set of places defined by their activity space. This activity space contains places such as households, schools, workplaces, or neighborhood locations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur when an infected person visits the same location as a susceptible person on the same day. Numbers of contacts per person are specific to each place type. For instance, school contacts do not depend on the size of the school but the age of the agent. Infected agents have a probability to stay at home if they develop symptoms. Those who do not stay at home continue their daily activities. Public health interventions are included in the model to represent the changes in agents’ behavior in response to an epidemic.  In this study, we limited the interventions to school closure and shelter in place. Schools are closed on a specific date to represent state-level guidelines (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020). In the case that schools are closed, students limit their activity space to household or neighborhood locations. Shelter-in-place interventions reduce each agent’s activity space to their household at a compliance level from 0-100%, which was estimated as part of the model calibration. Agents who do not comply with the shelter-in-place orders continue with their daily routines. We used state-level orders to determine the date at which people are advised to shelter in place (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020).  See the methods file in our repo for more detailed methods and model limitations.
Updates 2020-05-11 - We updated our likelihood used in our calibration, switching from a Poisson to a negative binomial distribution in order to allow for greater over-dispersion in the distribution of deaths. - We changed the way that we calculate the proportion of the population that is sheltering in place. We no longer use the dates at which government advisories were issued. Instead, we now exclusively use the google mobility data (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on journeys made to residential locations. We calibrate the maximum compliance to shelter in place, and use a generalized additive model fitted to the google data to forecast movement in the coming 5 weeks.
